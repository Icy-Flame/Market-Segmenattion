## Data Description
The dataset summarizes the usage behaviourof 9000 credit card holders during the last 6 months based on 18 behavioural variables.


## Data
The data set is here


## Models
In this dataset I have used K-Means Clustering algorithm to divide the whole customer into different clusters based on their different behaviour.


## Clusters
By using Elbow Method in K Means clustering I have found four clusters. By observing these four clusters I have found the charcteristic of the customers of each of the clusters.


## Conclusion
Based on the clusters we can categoraized a new customer of the bank as a member of one of the clusters and based on that bank can give the advice regarding different banking policy to that customer.
